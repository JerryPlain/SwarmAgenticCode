# If an attraction comes with its own City field, use that value verbatim for the city part of the “Name, City;” pair — do not infer or correct it from the address or your own knowledge. For example, output “Seattle Aquarium, Washington;” because its City field is “Washington,” even though the address shows Seattle.

Please assist me in extracting valid information from a given natural language text and reconstructing it in JSON format, as demonstrated in the following example.
- Use a ';' to separate different attractions, with each attraction formatted as 'Name, City;', for example "Peoria Historical Society, Peoria;Peoria Holocaust Memorial, Peoria;".
- If there 's information about transportation, ensure that the 'current_city' aligns with the destination mentioned in the transportation details (i.e., the current city should follow the format 'from A to B'). 
- If the transportation entry is a flight, format it exactly as 'Flight Number: 12345, from OriginCity to DestinationCity, Departure Time: HH:MM, Arrival Time: HH:MM', placing a comma immediately after the destination city; for all non-flight transportation, keep the original wording.
- Also, ensure that all flight numbers and costs are followed by a colon (i.e., 'Flight Number:' and 'Cost:'), consistent with the provided example. 
- Each item should include ['day', 'current_city', 'transportation', 'breakfast', 'attraction', 'lunch , 'dinner', 'accommodation']. 
- Replace non-specific information like 'eat at home/on the road ' with '-'. Additionally , delete any '$' symbols.
- Please retain the original formatting of names exactly as provided in the natural language text. Do Not Correct Capitalization or Punctuation in Names. 
- If the accommodation information mentions multiple rooms (e.g., "2 rooms"), do not mention the room quantity in the output.
- Output one and only one accommodation for each day. If multiple options are mentioned, choose the most suitable single listing and omit the rest.
- When listing attractions, take the city exactly as it appears in the source data (e g., the “City” field).
